    "Susan has lived in Downtown Toronto for a long time. She lived in other boroughs in Toronto before but she likes Downtown Toronto the most. She feels safe and happy with the restaurants, shops, recreational and enterainment facilities nearby. She enjoys her life so much there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently Susan has got an offer from a tech copmany in New York, which she has always been dreaming to work in, so she has decided to move to New York to follow her dream. The first thing to do is to find a place to settle down everything. She is looking for an apartment but she has no idea how to start with. She has never been to New York before and she knows New Tork is a big city that she may find difficulty living in such big city. Of course she doesn't know much about how similar New York it is compared to Toronto nor the boroughs/neigbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "A safer solution is that she can find a place which is similar to Downtown Toronto. Then it may be easier for her to adapt the pace of New York. There is little information online about the comparison of boroughs/neigbourhoods between New York and Toronto. She needs to make the decision within the next 2 weeks and she doesn't feel she can make it with the current information she've got. She is struggling. Luckily Susan remembers you have told her that you works in Data Science recently and thinks you may be able to help her to find out a solution.\n",

    "Susan is a good friend of you, therefore you are happy to help. Now you decide to find a way to analyse the data and see if you can find a recommendation for her.\n"
